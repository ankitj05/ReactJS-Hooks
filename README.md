# React Hooks

Here you will find all the examples of React Hooks, along with the comparison of implementation in the class components and functional components.

## Why hooks ?
1. this keyword - makes it difficult to understand and go through the code base.

2. Lifecycle methods - are difficult to maintain. Only Class Components are allowed to have states, which makes passing the states using props look inconvinient. Specially when there are nested components and only the last element of the tree is going to use the state defined in the top level component. 

3. All the code need to be written in the same component, which makes it difficult to separate out the unrelated code. 

## Hooks added in this repo. 

### useState
    1. Basic implementation.
    2. state depending on previous state.
    3. state with objects or arrays. 

### useEffect
    1. Basic implementation
    2. Conditional side effects
    3. Cleanup the side effects when the component is unmounted.
